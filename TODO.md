# TODO List

## Priority Tasks
- [ ] 

## Features to Implement
- [ ] Create more module types for the spaceship (e.g., shield, boost, repair drone)
- [ ] Visual effects for laser impact on asteroids (particles, sparks, etc.)
- [ ] **Inventory UI**
  - [ ] Add inventory display panel to top-right of screen
  - [ ] Show inventory items with icons, type names, and quantities
  - [ ] Update display in real-time as inventory changes
  - [ ] Style panel with semi-transparent background and borders
- [ ] **Critical Hit Mining System**
  - [ ] Add critical hit chance to mining laser module
  - [ ] Implement variable mining outcomes (normal, critical, super-critical)
  - [ ] Add visual feedback for critical hits (larger text, special effects)
  - [ ] Balance mining rates and critical hit probabilities
  - [ ] Add sound effects for different mining outcomes
- [ ] **Dynamic Audio System with Pyo**
  - [ ] Integrate pyo audio library for procedural sound generation
  - [ ] Create unique sound profiles for each ore type
  - [ ] Implement dynamic frequency modulation based on amount mined
  - [ ] Add amplitude modulation based on mining success/critical hits
  - [ ] Create smooth transitions between different mining states
  - [ ] Add audio feedback for asteroid depletion
